# EXPLANATIONS --------------------------------------------------------
# The existence of two functions is on purpose and intends to cover
# several usecases:
#   1. Build the path towards an SBML file independently from a model,
#      for example if you want to convert an Antimony file into the
#      SBML format regardless of the SPARCED pipeline.
#      This is the purpose of 'build_sbml_model_path()'.
#   2. Build the path towards an SBML file that corresponds to a model,
#      for example if you want to find where a model's SBML file should
#      be located based on the informations passed into this model.
#      This is the purpose of 'get_sbml_model_path()'.
# Hence, despite the apparent redundancy of those two functions, please
# do not remove them as they are complementary.
